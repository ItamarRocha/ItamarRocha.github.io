                                        Hey! I am a second-year Computational Science and Engineering master's student at Harvard University, working in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), advised by Sham Kakade. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at the Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB) in Brazil.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
										At Harvard, I’m a Teaching Fellow for AC215 (MLOps & LLMOps) and a Machine Learning Researcher at the Kempner Institute, focusing on Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Previously, I interned twice at Google (YouTube and Search) and twice at Meta (AI for AR and Ads).
									</p>
									<p>
										During my undergraduate degree, I was a member of the <a href="https://aria.ci.ufpb.br/en/sobre/">Artificial Intelligence Applications Laboratory (ARIA Lab)</a> at UFPB. There, I contributed to projects and research (published two papers) and wrote my thesis on LLM-powered e‑commerce experiences.
									</p>
                                    <p>
                                        In addition to my academic pursuits, I co-founded <a href="https://github.com/TailUFPB">TAIL (Technology and Artificial Intelligence League)</a>, a non-profit organization oriented by the ARIA Lab professors. The academic league aims to teach new students, produce content, contribute to the AI and Data Analysis field, and help the members achieve their goals (internships, graduation programs, and full-time jobs). It currently has more than 65 active members throughout Brazil and other countries.                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        On the industry side, I have interned twice at Google (YouTube and Search), twice at Meta (AI for AR and Ads), and I have experience in startups (<a href="https://praso.com.br">Praso</a>, <a href="https://atoptima.com/">Atoptima</a>, and  <a href="https://deco.cx/">deco.cx</a> - where I worked for almost 2 years). I am also a Fundação Estudar's Tech Fellow (One of 1.5% approved over thousands of applications in 2021).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
										I like running, playing football (the one and only ⚽), surfing, and reading in my spare time.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        Medway is a middle-sized (300 students) course at João Pessoa - PB. The problem here consists in allocating each student to one of the 15 advisors based on the
                                         time needed by the student and the estimated compatibility between each pair to let things balanced and not overload any advisor. The project was done using IBM CPLEX and some preprocessig libraries.
